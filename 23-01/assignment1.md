Class Assignment
================

1. Search for Penicillin Binding Protein 5 of Escherichia Coli
   from the NCBI website.

2. Retrieve the amino acid sequence in FASTA format.

3. Run BLAST with the query.

4. Filter the results in two categories corresponding to their Gram Positive
   and Gram Negative nature.

5. Retrieve the obtained hits and run an multiple sequence alignment.

6. Find out the conserved domain.

Aim of Assignment
=================

Whenever we try to characterize or find out the function of a new
protein, finding conserved residues is one of the first tasks.
It has been observed that even though amino acids within the sequence are
often mutated, the overall structure and function of protein is maintained.
This is possible because of some highly conserved and short sequence of
amino acids which code for the critical functionality of that protein - be the
active site or interacting surface.

Not only within a single species, but these sequences have been observed to be
highly conserved even across many species. This allows us to establish the role
of a protein, classify the organism, and etc.,
